# Interface

A personal creative writing project which began September 2023. Narratives and
worldbuilding cover a wide range of themes from politics to artificial
intelligence. See `book` for official content. Here is a snippet:

> *The Slice*, or the slice, refers to a specific program family, invented by
> teenage hackers in the 2060s, which utilize joining programs to kill a person.
> To begin the Slice, hemispherectomy software is executed along the initially
> programmed plane in the mind (between hemispheres). This also signals to
> knowledgeable recipients the coming end of their life. Then, the
> hemispherectomy software, which runs as a daemon to maintain the plane
> separating the mind, is fed bogus information, causing the bisection plane to
> rotate along numerous positions in the mind. The point, speed, and direction
> of rotation jump randomly. The severing of the mind into such small sections
> rapidly stops normal brain function causing seizures, comas, and even death.
