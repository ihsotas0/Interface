Overexerting your data rate leads to instant (deadly) signal severance. This is
what happens in the last stand of runners in the Matrix.

Adam Task compute allocation:
    90% - Signal processes (8-bit TPU)
    5% - Fee
    5% - Environment compute (double-precision floats)


The reason all avatars in the Matrix are humanoid is because of the requirements
set in place by the Adam Task. Signals, which the Adam Task handles, are the I/O
of the host; it follows that to create the signal _in the first place_ requires
an entity of similar likeness to what normally creates the "organic signal". But
the host can withstand a certain level of difference, which allows for the
famous pseudonym and anonymity of the Cipher. A virtual "spirit" avatar can be
created to embody the signal while the "actual" avatar is non-humanoid, but
controlling this "actual" avatar is no different from controlling a simulated
robot in the Matrix. "Spirit" avatars do not exist as a default protocol in
Program Space, making invisibility without a dedicated Method impossible. (This
invisibility comes from having a "spirit" avatar without an "actual" avatar.)
