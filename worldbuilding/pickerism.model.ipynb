    "> --- Yaqut, Father of Pickerist Thought on Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "Yaqut, visionary political theorist of the 2070s, created the first Oracle and\n",
    "laid the foundations of what would become Pickerism not soon after. Interfaced\n",
    "in 2048 by his rich family, Yaqut was one of the first people to voluntarily go\n",
    "beyond the return limit at 18 years old. He embedded himself full-time at first\n",
    "in the newly founded Bussard Mesh (`1:700`), like any good hached mesher, but\n",
    "eventually decided to commit part-time to his personal studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the significant money he made while embedded in the Bussard Mesh over the\n",
    "course of 4 years (given his knack for meshing), he rented an expensive cryotank\n",
    "capable of `1:2000` haching. (In this case he spent `700` in the Bussard Mesh\n",
    "and `1300` on his personal studies.) Yaqut avoided being drafted during the Data\n",
    "War since he was hached, since hached people were no more effective than\n",
    "non-hached people in Program Space. The Bussard Mesh was his \"service\" during\n",
    "the war.\n",
    "\n",
    "His personal studies lasted thousands of years. He made a deep dive into the\n",
    "writings of hundreds of political theorists, past and present, and came to the\n",
    "Conclusion \"kill whitey\". He proved his Conclusion with a 14 thousand-page work\n",
    "of symbolic logic. Scholars were, despite millions of man-years, not able to\n",
    "disprove his sound Conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following his political work, Yaqut moved onto other areas of study. Sometime\n",
    "during this shift, although the exact details are vague, Yaqut discovered the\n",
    "existence of Pickers by accidentally creating an Oracle (a machine which allows\n",
    "Pickers to communicate by interacting with a few, easily observable quantum\n",
    "particles). Some argued that Yaqut's Oracle was fake, and that all Oracles made\n",
    "after follow in line, and this is a fairly popular view. Some argued that\n",
    "Pickerism was invented by Yaqut to enact his Conclusion upon the world. In this\n",
    "way, Yaqut was seen as the anti-Yakubian of his time. Regardless, he died in\n",
    "2073 soon after publishing Pickerism when a Super-Chooser victim's relative\n",
    "killed him.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickerism postulates that there is a Picker who decides the outcome of all\n",
    "stochastic events in the Universe at any given time. The Picker exists outside\n",
    "the Universe but within the same time dimension, so the Picker experiences the\n",
    "time of their labor, which, in the 21st century, is around 10 thousand years.\n",
    "Because of this, many consider the Picker's job to be Hell itself. But this time\n",
    "accounts for less than an attosecond in the Universe. (Picker's labor to decide\n",
    "the states of all particles in the Universe during a period of time less than an\n",
    "attosecond before being replaced, but to them, this is 10 thousand years of\n",
    "torture).\n",
    "\n",
    "*All conscious beings become Pickers upon death.* Since this includes the entire\n",
    "Universe, with trillions and trillions of inhabited worlds, the death rate is\n",
    "beyond any reasonable analog (see Picker Calculus for details). The death rate\n",

    "## Transcendentalism vs Cascade Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main academic forms of Pickerist thought are Transcendentalism and\n",
    "Cascade Theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cascade theory: each Picker has another Picker, to make them conscience,\n",
    "which goes on forever to ensure no being is not \"Picked\" for their own\n",
    "sentience. This means that all beings live forever as Pickers. Infinite Hell.\n",
    "But it can never be proven since the Picker, in there space outside the\n",
    "Universe, has no access to an Oracle to determine there is another Picker above\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentience Obliteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentience obliteration: by totally destroying your mind, beyond recovery as a\n",
    "postmortem Picker, you avoid Infinite Hell. You have to become non-sentient\n",

    "our minds at anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Transcendentalists' War\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that Cascade Theory is correct, the Transcendentalists became a\n",
    "war to maintain the Picker time. The Crops of sentient beings they fostered were\n",
    "mercilessly purged to ensure a stable death rate across the Universe.\n",
    "\n",
