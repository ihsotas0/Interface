# Pickerism

> "There are no gods among the Pickers, only the damned." 
> 
> --- Yaqut, Father of Pickerism on Earth

Yaqut, visionary political theorist of the 2070s, created the first Oracle and
laid the foundations of what would become Pickerism not soon after. Interfaced
in 2048 by his rich family, Yaqut was one of the first people to voluntarily go
beyond the return limit at 18 years old. He embedded himself full-time at first
in the newly founded Bussard Mesh (1:700), like any good hached mesher, but
eventually decided to commit part-time to his personal studies by time-sharing,
which he was uniquely capable of.

With the significant money he made while embedded in the Bussard Mesh over the
course of 4 years (given his knack for meshing), he rented an expensive cryotank
capable of 1:2000 haching. (In this case he spent 700 in the Bussard Mesh and
1300 on his personal studies.) Yaqut avoided being drafted during the Data War
since he was hached, since hached people were no more effective than non-hached
people in Program Space. The Bussard Mesh, owned by the American government
(although used productively for peaceful purposes), was his "service" during the
war.

His personal studies lasted thousands of years. He made a deep dive into the
writings of hundreds of political theorists, past and present, and came to the
Conclusion "kill whitey". He proved his Conclusion with a 14 thousand-page work
of pure logic. Scholars were, despite millions of man-years, not able to
disprove his sound Conclusion.

Following his political work, Yaqut moved onto other areas of study. Sometime
during this shift, although the exact details are vague, Yaqut discovered the
existence of Pickers by accidentally creating an Oracle (a machine which allows
Pickers to communicate by interacting with a few, easily observable quantum
particles). Some argued that Yaqut's Oracle was fake, and that all Oracles made
after follow in line, and this is a fairly popular view. Some argued that
Pickerism was invented by Yaqut to enact his Conclusion upon the world. In this
way, Yaqut was seen as the anti-Yakubian of his time. Regardless, he died in
2073 soon after publishing Pickerism when a Super-Chooser victim's relative
assassinated him.

## Introduction

Pickerism postulates that there is a Picker who decides the outcome of all
stochastic events in the Universe at any given time. The Picker exists outside
the Universe but still experiences the time of their labor, which, in the 21st
century, is around one thousand years. Because of this, many consider the
Picker's job to be Hell itself.

But this time accounts for less than an attosecond in the Universe. (Picker's
labor to decide the states of all particles in the Universe during a period of
time less than an attosecond before being replaced, but to them, this is one
thousand years of torture). The Picker time is so small that, in the time it
takes a photon to cross a hydrogen atom, over a hundred Pickers control the
Universe.

*All conscious beings become Pickers upon death.* Since this includes the entire
Universe, with trillions and trillions of inhabited worlds, the death rate is
beyond any reasonable analog (see Picker Calculus for details). The death rate
is what determines the Picker time. The minimum time Pickers must exist for is
exactly the time between deaths, since the next person to die becomes Picker.
Thus. a high death rate leads to a low Picker time and a low death rate to a
high one.

Some Pickers, however, go beyond the minimum Picker time for the sake of others
(or to control the Universe substantially).

Whether AI/AC beings become Pickers is a debate equal to whether or not they are
sentient. Many people confirm there position on AI based on the communications
from Oracles. (The Oracles say that there are AI Pickers, but there is no way to
prove this.)

Oracles have never shown a human, since there are simply so many aliens.

## Transcendentalism vs Cascade Theory

The two main academic forms of Pickerist thought are Transcendentalism and
Cascade Theory.

The Cascade theory: each Picker has another Picker, to make them conscience,
which goes on forever to ensure no being is not "Picked" for their own
sentience. This means that all beings live forever as Pickers. Infinite Hell.
But it can never be proven since the Picker, in there space outside the
Universe, has no access to an Oracle to determine there is another Picker above
them.

Cascade Theorists act just like Transcendentalists, trying to get people to do
lobotomycore as soon as possible to avoid the chance of dying while sentient.

### Sentience Obliteration

Sentience obliteration: by totally destroying your mind, beyond recovery as a
postmortem Picker, you avoid Infinite Hell. You have to become non-sentient
while alive. To do this, massive Brainrot is required.

### Artificial Consciousness Discourse

## The One True Harold (Messiah)

One True Harold who expands consciousness beyond instantaneous present

We are all products of the Picker's conscience, since they Pick the states of
our minds at anytime.

## The Transcendentalists' War

Only evidence is the decrease in death rate and extrapolation of infinitesimal
variations in the data.

Despite the fact that Cascade Theory is correct, the Transcendentalists became a
war to maintain the Picker time. The Crops of sentient beings they fostered were
mercilessly purged to ensure a stable death rate across the Universe.

At the end of the War, world's started doing mass suicide.

## Cult Behavior on Earth

Changers create Helpers, Choosers create Listeners, and Super-Choosers create
Survivors.

### Controllers

### Changers

Create Helpers

### Choosers

Emerged during the end of the Transcendentalists' War (which took 1000 years).

#### Super-Choosers

| Name          | Survivors Created        |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Chooser       | 0                        |
| Super-Chooser | 10 -- 1 million          |
| Mega-Chooser  | 1 million -- 50 million  |
| Giga-Chooser  | 50 million -- 10 billion |

While the connotation of "Super-Choosers" was that they create unwilling
Survivors as opposed to willing Listeners, the term originally denoted
traditional Choosers who created large numbers of Listeners (10+). As the
Super-Chooser movement emerged, traditional Choosers sought to distance
themselves from what they called "mass killers" and stopped calling themselves
Super-Choosers.

The Super-Choosers hoped for the emergence of Mega-Choosers and Giga-Choosers;
or for an individual or group with similar Survivor creation numbers to announce
themselves as such.
