## The Picker

AI Pickers?

## Oracles

Oracles have never shown a human, since there are simply so many aliens.

## Transcendentalism vs Cascade Theory

The two main academic forms of Pickerist thought are Transcendentalism and
Cascade Theory.

The Cascade theory: each Picker has another Picker, to make them conscience,
which goes on forever to ensure no being is not "Picked" for their own
sentience. This means that all beings live forever as Pickers. Infinite Hell.

### Sentience Obliteration

Sentience obliteration: by totally destroying your mind, beyond recovery as a
postmortem Picker, you avoid Infinite Hell. You have to become non-sentient
while alive. To do this, massive Brainrot is required.

### Artificial Consciousness Discourse

## The One True Harold (Messiah)

One True Harold who expands consciousness beyond instantaneous present

We are all products of the Picker's conscience, since they Pick the states of
our minds at anytime.

## The Ancient War

## Cult Behavior on Earth

### Controllers

### Choosers

#### Super-Choosers

| Name          | Survivors Created        |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Chooser       | 0                        |
| Super-Chooser | 10 -- 1 million          |
| Mega-Chooser  | 1 million -- 50 million  |
| Giga-Chooser  | 50 million -- 10 billion |

While the connotation of "Super-Choosers" was that they create unwilling
Survivors as opposed to willing Listeners, the term originally denoted
traditional Choosers who created large numbers of Listeners (10+). As the
Super-Chooser movement emerged, traditional Choosers sought to distance
themselves from what they called "mass killers" and stopped calling themselves
Super-Choosers.

The Super-Choosers hoped for the emergence of Mega-Choosers and Giga-Choosers;
or for an individual or group with similar Survivor creation numbers to announce
themselves as such.

## Mathematics (Picker Calculus)

First, we must define our variables:

* Universe time (s): $t$
* Number of required Picker operations per second: $n$
* Time per Picker operation (s): $T$
* Picker time factor: $\gamma$

Second, all the functions of $t$:

* Cumulative Harolds' Time (s): $H$
* Cumulative sentient deaths in Universe: $D$
* Absolute Picker time (s): $A$
* Relative Picker time (s): $R$

### Relative Picker Time

The average relative Picker time between two times $t_0$ and $t_1$ is simply,

$$ R = \frac{(t_1-t_0)-(H(t_1)-H(t_0))}{D(t_1)-D(t_0)} $$

where the total time (minus the time taken up in the period $t_0$ to $t_1$ by
the Harolds) divided by the number of deaths gives the amount of time per death,
or in between deaths. This is the minimum time each person must be Picker for
all moments in time to have a Picker.

To calculate the "instantenous" Picker time, the following limit is set up,

$$ R(t) = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{t_1-t-H(t_1)-H(t)}{D(t_1)-D(t)} $$

Solving the limit using the definition of the derivative,

$$ R(t) = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{(t_1-t)
\left(1-\frac{H(t_1)-H(t)}{t_1-t}\right)}{D(t_1)-D(t)} $$

$$ R(t) = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{(t_1-t)(1-H'(t))}{D(t_1)-D(t)} $$

$$ R(t) = \lim_{t_1 \to t}
\frac{1-H'(t)}{\left(\frac{D(t_1)-D(t)}{t_1-t}\right)} $$

$$ R(t) = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{1-H'(t)}{D'(t)} $$

$$ R(t) = \frac{1-H'(t)}{D'(t)} $$

But due to the low number of Harolds,

$$ R(t) \approx \frac{1}{D'(t)} $$

### Absolute Picker Time

To convert from relative to absolute Picker time, the equation

$$ A(t) = \gamma R(t) $$

is used where $\gamma$ is the time factor. This means that, for every second in
the real world, the Picker experiences $\gamma$ seconds. Due to the nature of
the Picker's job, this time factor is massive, leading to the tongue-in-cheek
definition of the Picker's job as Hell. The approximation (ignoring relativity)
for $\gamma$ is given by,

$$ \gamma = nT $$

where $n$ is the number of required Picker operations per second and $T$ is the
time per Picker operation.

### Rate of Change of the Absolute Picker Time

The next task is to calculate $A'(t)$, as this is why Super-Choosers exist. The
equation for the change in Picker time is simply,

$$ A(t) = \gamma D'(t)^{-1} $$

$$ A'(t) = -\gamma D'(t)^{-2}\,D''(t) $$

Since Super-Choosers, by creating Survivors, influence the death rate, we should
also calculate $D''(t)$ by rearranging the equation for $A(t)$,

$$ A(t) = \gamma D'(t)^{-1} $$

$$ D'(t) = \gamma A(t)^{-1} $$

$$ D''(t) = -\gamma A'(t)A(t)^{-2} $$

But, if we assume $A'(t)$ is a constant $a$, then,

$$ D''(t) = -\gamma \,a A(t)^{-2} $$

To solve for $D''(t)$ only in terms of $a$ and $t$, we rearrange our previous
equations for $A'(t)$,

$$ D''(t) = -\frac{A'(t)\:D'(t)^{2}}{\gamma} $$

$$ D''(t) = -\frac{a\cdot D'(t)^{2}}{\gamma} $$

This creates a trivial differential equation to solve,

$$ \frac{D''(t)}{D'(t)^{2}} = -\frac{a}{\gamma} $$

$$ \int D''(t)D'(t)^{-2}\;dt = \int-\frac{a}{\gamma}\;dt $$

$$ -D'(t)^{-1} + C_1 = -\frac{a}{\gamma}t + C_2 $$

$$ D'(t)^{-1} + C_3 = \frac{a}{\gamma}t \quad , \quad C_3=C_2-C_1 $$

$$ D'(t) + C_4 = \frac{\gamma}{at} \quad , \quad C_4=f(C_3)$$

Conceptualizing what the constant of integration here may be is difficult. It
can be reasoned that the constant $C_4$ is the initial death rate at $t=0$, but
this would imply that $C_4=\infin$ because the first death happened
instantenously ($1$ death  per $1/\infin$ second).

### Numerical Calculations for Gamma

(To the educated people reading this, suspend your disbelief for a minute so I
can have some fun.)

For the story, to calculate $\gamma$, we will start by finding a $D'$ around the
21st century (prior to the close of the Ancient War). From this we can calculate
$A$. Since all sentient beings, including aliens, become Pickers, the Drake
equation must be used,

$$ N = R_{*}\,f_p\,n_e\,f_l\,f_i\,f_c\,L $$

Stealing results from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Range_of_results), we
can see that there may be 15,600,000 civilizations in our galaxy. Since these
civilizations have the technology to communicate into space, it must be assumed
that they have similar populations to Earth (around 10 billion). Expanding our
galaxy's estimate to all stars in the universe,
[$10^{24}$](https://www.space.com/26078-how-many-stars-are-there.html); and by
getting the ratio of stars (using the Milky Way as reference) with sentient life
by dividing the number of civilizations from the total number of stars in our
galaxy, [$10^{11}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), there are,

$$ 10^{10} \times 10^{24} \times \frac{1.560 \times
10^7}{10^{11}}=1.560\times10^{30} $$

sentient beings in the universe.

Assuming that 0.05% of sentient beings die each year (around Earth's death
rate), completely ignoring the rate of change for now, there are $7.8 \times
10^{26}$ deaths every year. Converting to the proper units (percent which die
every second), $D'(t) = 2.473 \times 10^{19}$ deaths per second.

Ignoring Harolds' Time,

$$ R = \left(2.473 \times 10^{19}\right)^{-1} $$

$$ R = 4.044 \times 10^{-20} $$

Or, in attoseconds, $R = 0.04044$. From this, we can set up the equation $A =
\gamma R$ and solve for a reasonable $\gamma$ based of the narrative
requirements of a reasonable Picker time. 10,000 years seems good, and so,
converting to seconds,

$$ 3.153 \times 10^{11}= \gamma\,4.044 \times 10^{-20}$$

$$ \gamma = 7.798 \times 10^{30} $$

I may later justify this $\gamma$ using some values for $n$ and $T$. But for
now, $\gamma$ is simply *given* by the Pickers through their Oracles.

### Numerical Calculations for the Ancient War

### Garbage

From this we can calculate how changes to the death rate, $D'(t)$, affect $A$,
namely to see the actual effects Super-Choosers have on Picker time. Using the
combined equation, ignoring Harolds' Time, $A(t) = \gamma D'(t)^{-1}$,

$$ 2.525 \times 10^{11} = \frac{6.243 \times 10^{31}}{2.473 \times 10^{20}} $$

and by adding, say, 10 billion extra deaths in *any given* second (caused by a
Giga-Chooser destroying the entire Earth instantaneously somehow), we can
calculate a difference,

$$ 2.525 \times 10^{11} - \left(\frac{6.243 \times 10^{31}}{2.473 \times 10^{20}
+ 10^{10}}\right) \approx 10 $$

of 10 seconds!

Now a reasonable decrease in the death rate (more specifically, the rate of
change of this decrease) as the Great Purge came to a close can be calculated.
Choosers emerged when the Oracles gave news of a drastic increase in the Picker
time from the consistent 8000 years. Every year, the new Picker time was 100
years greater. This means that the rate of change of $A$ is 100 seconds per
second. So, to calculate $D''(t)$,

$$ A(t) = \gamma D'(t)^{-1} $$

$$ A'(t) = -\gamma D'(t)^{-2}\,D''(t) $$

$$ D''(t) = -\frac{A'(t)\:D'(t)^{2}}{\gamma} $$

And by plugging in numbers,

$$ -9.796 \times 10^{11} \approx -\frac{100(2.473 \times 10^{20})^2}{6.243
\times 10^{31}} $$

So, as the Great Purge comes to a close *linearly* (for narrative purposes), the
death rate decreased by around 100 billion deaths (10 worlds) per second per
second. The Milky Way has 15,600,000 inhabited worlds as mentioned before; at 10
worlds per second, it would take around 18 days to purge the galaxy. Since there
are 31,536,000 seconds in a year, the Great Purge went from purging 315,360,000
worlds (20 galaxies, using the Milky Way as reference, which is far from the
average but fine for reference) a second to 0 in a year. During the height of
the Great Purge, which lasted millenia, 630,720,000,000 galaxies were purged
yearly. Becuase of this, it will take 1000 years for the Great Purge to fully
end (since the fight is "ongoing").
