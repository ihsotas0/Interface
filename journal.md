* Thought: Juxtaposition of Palestine genocide and "Trump not laughing".
* "Seeing how AI is better than 99% of people really shows the importance of the
  remaining 1%" is nonsense.
* Check out MIT liquid neural nets
* The Traveler ends with this: "You idiots, do the revolution! It's so simple!
  All the other 'aliens' have, so why not you? You are entirely unique in many
  ways, but so are all the others. Your languages and music, their logical
  structure compaction and improved conscience objectivity."
* Foodpak
* "Hacking bomb" AI mini computer, like digital pathogens (not computer malware,
  since they are physical)
* Graph database of everything
* Black Mirror Interface "social media"
* Onion black boxes/communities
* Sitting in a lecture hall, and for half a second, all the necks snap backwards

No-one not directly employed at the company --- and its single factory --- had
every seen anything beyond the end-product, itself delivered in a similar manner
to special, highly-secure stores. Attacking the end-product or the retail stores
was limited in scale compared to attacking the source, which is why Dylan went
out of his way with this hack.

* "Rice" computers are "common-place". A nuisance.

Infects the rice supplier of the factory -> rice left in trash, plates, floors,
and in people's guts -> mainly from rice in people's guts, they act as a mesh
network on extremely low power to avoid detection and attempt to hack the
factory.

Food standards became more stringent after the incident, but the original
creators of the Rice Hack never thought to create a more general payload to
infect entire food supply-chains (although such a thing is likely impossible,
since the payload is limited in its generality).
