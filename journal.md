No-one not directly employed at the company --- and its single factory --- had
every seen anything beyond the end-product, itself delivered in a similar manner
to special, highly-secure stores. Attacking the end-product or the retail stores
was limited in scale compared to attacking the source, which is why Dylan went
out of his way with this hack.

"Rice" computers are "common-place". A nuisance.

Infects the rice supplier of the factory -> rice left in trash, plates, floors,
and in people's guts -> mainly from rice in people's guts, they act as a mesh
network on extremely low power to avoid detection and attempt to hack the
factory.

Food standards became more stringent after the incident, but the original
creators of the Rice Hack never thought to create a more general payload to
infect entire food supply-chains (although such a thing is likely impossible,
since the payload is limited in its generality).
